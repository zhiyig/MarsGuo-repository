# Final Project Part 1
# Author: Mars Guo

# Outline
My final project would introduce countries' goals on achieving net zero carbon emission.
1. Introduce the carbon emission amount of each country.
2. Introduce each countries' target year to achieve net zero.
3. Visualize the predicted total net carbon emission from now to 2100, based on the prediction of countries' change of carbon emission in the futre.

# Sketches



# Data
The Timeline of Carbon Neutral Targets by country provided by [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/climate-target-update-tracker/)
The predicted and current emission of each country provided by [World Resources Institute](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/cait-emissions-projections)

# Method and medium
I will choose to use shorthand.
