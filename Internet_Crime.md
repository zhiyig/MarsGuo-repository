# Assignment 3&4: Critique by Design

## Step one: Find a data visualization
Here I used a visualization from the [2018 Internet Crime Report](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2018_IC3Report.pdf) provided by FBI.
The visualization I selected is on the page 17, and it is a visualization shows the top 20 foreign countries of the highest number of victims of internet crime.
This is a screenshot of the visualization:

## Step three: wireframe a solution
Based on my feeling in reading this visualization, I came up about two main ideas to improve this visualzation:
1. Replace the map with bar chart to emphasize the number of victims and ranking among the countries;
2. Using color for each country to represent the continent the country belong to, in order to give audience a hint about where the country locate at.
Here is my wireframe:

## Test the solution
After drawing my wireframe, I bring my wireframe to my two roomates and asked for their comments and suggestions.
Here is their answer to my questions:
1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
* Zhuang: This is a ranking of the number of victims happened to countries
* Yitian: Right.
2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
* Zhuang: I am really surprised that the rank of China is so low. I am surprised that developed country such as United Kingdom have so many victims of the Internet Crime. Based on my experience in China, I always thought that Internet Crime in China is extremely frequent.
* Yitian: I thought the data of victim of internet crime in China is problematic, there must have been a lot of victims not detected by the provider of the data.
3. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
* Zhuang: I would try to include the United States in this chart, also, I would like to include the trend of increase or decrease of victims of each country into this chart, though it could be challenging.
* Yitian: I think you should include the source of the data on the chart, since it is essential to make audience trust in your chart.
