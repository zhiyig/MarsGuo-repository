### I have created a bar chart, a grid of line chart and a connected dot chart, based on the same database providede by OECD. 
* The bar chart emphasize on ranking the government-debt-to-GDP ratio among different countries.
* The grid of line chart emphasize on presenting the timeline of government-debt-to-GDP ratio of each country individually.
* The connected dot chart emphasize on showing the change and range of the government-debt-to-GDP ratio of each country across time, and also provide a easy way to compare among different countries.
