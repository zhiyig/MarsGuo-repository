# Final project part 2
## We are facing the challenges of climate change, the carbon dioxide concentration in atmosphere has raised more than 30% compare to the highest in the history

## Human activities in the past 50 years have led to a sharp rise in the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

## In order to tackle the climate change, countries set goals on achieving carbon neutrality, which means achieving net zero emission of carbon dioxide. 

### There are countires which already announced that they achieved net zero in 2020, inlcuding Bhutan.

### There are countries which will achieve net zero in 2035, included Finland and Iceland.

## User research
Target audience: University students who want to gain knowledge about carbon net zero

Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview: Interview at bus stops near universities

Interview script:
1. How confident you feel about the knowledge of climate change?
2. Have you heard about carbon net zero before?
3. Let the audience read the draft visualization story
4. After reading the visualization, is there any information you think is essential however not shown in the visulziation?
5. Do you have any recommendation regarding the visualization methods used in this visualization?


Findings from interviews:
1. People usually have knowledge about climate change, however, lack knowledge about net zero. 
2. Audience are curious about ways to participate in achieving net zero by taking daily actions.
3. Audience want to know more about how will countries take action to achieve net zero.

Changes plan to implementing to visualization
1. Need more information about what is net zero, the history of net zero targets, how to measure achieving net zero carbon emission
2. Need adding information about the carbon emission reduction methods countries will utilize, which industry are going to be influenced by this campagin.
3. Need to add information about what individual people could do to participate in achieving net zero.
