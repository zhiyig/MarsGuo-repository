# Final Project Part 3


## Changes made based on the user research during part 2
1. Added background knowledge about: what is climate change, the effects of climate change, the reason of climate change.
2. Added background knowledge about: the definition of net zero, call to action at the end
3. Added several media sources including YouTube video, personal carbon footprint calculator, in case audience want to gain more knowledge about climate change, and discover their own carbon footprint.
4.
